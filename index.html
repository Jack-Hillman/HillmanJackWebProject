<h2>Why Everyone Should Know how to Build a Computer</h2>
<p>Computers offer users endless information, pass times, and more!  As time moves on, we have seen computer become more and more important in our daily lives.  They are used in the work place,
at homes, and even in cars!  This is all the more reason to understand the basics of how they work.  Understanding everything about computers in nearly impossible, but hopefully I'll be able to
explain the basic functions of the seven main parts and how they work together to form the basis of a computer.</p>
<h3>What are the Seven Main Components?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Graphics Processing Unit(GPU)</li>
  <li>Central Processing Unit(CPU)</li>
  <li>Random Access Memory(RAM)</li>
  <li>Storage Drive</li>
  <li>Power Supply</li>
  <li>Motherboard</li>
  <li>Case</li>
</ul>
<p>These components all work together to run the computer that you are currently using to view this website.  For instructions on how to build the computer, <a href="HowToBuild.html">click here</a>,
