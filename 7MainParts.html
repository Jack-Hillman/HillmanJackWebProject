<dt><strong>What is a GPU?</strong></dt>
<dd>The Graphics Processing Unit is not needed for all computers, but if the user wants to render 3D models, edit videos, or play video games, it is recommended.
  A GPU is capable of processing many different task at once.</dd>
<dt><strong>What is a CPU?</strong></dt>
<dd>The most basic way to understand a CPU is to see it as the brain of a computer.  The CPU processes tells the other parts what, how, and when to complete specific task.
  It also processes many task, just like a GPU!</dd>
<dt><strong>What is a RAM?</strong></dt>
<dd>Have you ever noticed that the more a computer is doing, the slower it becomes?  That is probably because the RAM is sturggling to keep up with all of those task.
RAM can be seen as temporary storage.  For example, in order to keep a Google Chrome tab open, memory is needed to store the information and that is exactly what RAM does.</dd>
<dt><strong>What is a storage drive?</strong></dt>
<dd>Storage drives are exactly what they sound like.  There are many differnt types such as HHD, SSD, SATA, and NVME drives.  Some of which are quicker than others, but they all do the same thing...
store your data!  Whether it be games, files, pictures, or videos, they are all stored on drives.</dd>
<dt><strong>What is a power supply?</strong></dt>
<dd>A power supply is pretty self explanitory, it provides power to all of the parts in the computer.  The more power hungry the components in a computer, the more wattage your power supply
will have to be able to distribute.</dd>
<dt><strong>What is a motherboard?</strong></dt>
<dd>The motherboard is the part of the computer that everything is attached to.  If you look at a computer as a body, the motherboard is kind of like the skeleton.  It holds all of the parts
together and allows them to communicate.</dd>
<dt><strong>What is the case?</strong></dt>
<dd>Using the example from above, the case is kind of like the skin of the computer.  It hides all of the parts away and protects them from the dangers outside such as dust or food.</dd>
