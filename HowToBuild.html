<h2>How to Build Your Computer</h2>
  <p>So, you went out and bought the parts to your computer and are ready to build, but you don't know where to start.  Let me help you with that!  Look at a computer as building a
  LEGO set, follow the instructions and it will work as intended in the end.</p>
  <ul>
    <p><strong>Step One</strong></p>
    <li>Unwrap all of your parts and lay them out on a table in front of you</li>
    <p><strong>Step Two</strong></p>
    <li>Place your motherboard on top of it's box so you don't damage any of the pins on the bottom when forcing the parts in.  From here open the square socket in the middle of the board, align
    the arrow on the CPU with the arrow on the board and allow it to drop into place.  From here, lower the metal pin and push down until you hear a click.</li>
    <p><strong>Step Three</strong></p>
    <li>Apply a pinch of thermal paste(a little goes a long way) to the top of the CPU.  In your CPU box, a fan should be waiting.  Align it over the top of the CPU and screw it in.</li>
    <p><strong>Step Four</strong></p>
    <li>On the motherboard, there will be either four or eight long sockets all right next to each other.  Click them open, put your ram in every other socket or fill it, and then click it
    shut again.</li>
    <p><strong>Step Five</strong></p>
    <li>Next, scan your motherboard for three long, thin sockets.  Once you find them, align your GPU overhead and push it into place.  This might apply a little bit of pressure, but don't<table>
      worry, push!
    </table></li>
    <p><strong>Step Six</strong></p>
    <li>Grab your case and slide the power supply and drives into their allotted spots.  This will differ from case to case, but fear not, there are maps in each box that will show you
       were they are.</li>
    <p><strong>Step Seven</strong></p>
    <li>Screw the completed motherboard into the case as well as the drives and power supply.  From here, start plugging in cables.  As many cables as there are, they each have
    their own sockets that only they will fit into so it is very difficult to mess up this step.  Take your time and make sure that they are all plugged in!</li>
    <p><strong>Step Eight</strong></p>
    <li>Manage your cables, plug your computer in, and enjoy! (:</li>
